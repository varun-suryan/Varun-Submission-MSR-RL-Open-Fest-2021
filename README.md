I have modified the original .ipynb file two different exploration algorithms.
- epsilon-greedy with epsilon = 0.2 and
- Random Network Distillation (RND).

I have also created a fourth reward distribution which simulates the noise in actual ratings. The noise is modeled as a Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.05.
